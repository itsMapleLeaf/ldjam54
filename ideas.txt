level ideas:
- [x] multiple paths, one easy one difficult
- [ ] a bunch of hard turns
- [ ] straight with two moving level obstacles (which are the same color as the background) moving in opposite directions at a moderate speed
- [ ] straight with some moderate turns black holes at the sides
- [ ] a long, narrow, slightly-curved level
- [ ] big area with lots of moving obstacles all over the place moving at different speeds
- [ ] long narrow winding paths with black holes + bigger areas with moving obstacles
