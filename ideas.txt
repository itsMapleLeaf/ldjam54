level ideas:
- [x] multiple paths, one easy one difficult
- [x] a bunch of hard turns
- [x] straight with two moving level obstacles (which are the same color as the background) moving in opposite directions at a moderate speed
- [x] straight with some moderate turns black holes at the sides
- [x] a long, narrow, slightly-curved level
- [x] big area with lots of moving obstacles all over the place moving at different speeds
- [x] long narrow winding paths with black holes + bigger areas with moving obstacles
